        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-center mb-6">KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICY</h1>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          To maintain the highest level of security, we require all our members to provide us with certain documentation
          in order to validate their accounts.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-6">
          Please note that the identification procedures shall be done before a cardholder starts operating and using
          services of our merchants.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Why do I need to provide documentation?</h2>
  
        <p className="mb-2">There are several reasons:</p>
  
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>
            We are committed to providing a socially responsible platform for online gaming. All of our members must be 18
            or older and we are bound by our licensing agreement to verify this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in our interests to guarantee maximum security on all
            transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies are in line with international banking standards. A
            proven business relationship with each and every member is mandatory for the protection of all parties. Our
            licensing agreement also obliges us to comply with this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, by ensuring that your account details are absolutely correct, the inconvenience of 'missing payments'
            can be avoided. It can take weeks (and sometimes months) to trace, recall and resend using the correct
            information. This lengthy process also results in additional fees from our processors.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What documents do I need to provide?</h2>
  
        <h3 className="font-medium mb-1">Proof of ID:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A colour copy of a valid government issued form of ID (Driver's License, Passport, Country ID or Military ID)
        </p>
  
        <h3 className="font-medium mb-1">Proof of Address</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">A copy of a recent utility bill showing your address</p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          Note: If your government ID shows your address, you do not need to provide further proof of address.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-6">Additional documentation might be required depending on the withdrawal method you choose</p>
  
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">When do I need to provide these documents?</h2>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          We greatly appreciate your cooperation in providing these at your earliest possible convenience to avoid any
          delays in processing your transactions. We must be in receipt of the documents before any cash transactions can
          be sent back to you. Under special circumstances we may require the documents before further activity (deposits
          and wagering) can take place on your account
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-6">
          Please understand, if we do not have the required documents on file, your pending withdrawals will be cancelled
          and credited back to your account. You will be notified when this happens via the notification system.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How can I Email you these documents?</h2>
  
        <p className="mb-6">
          Please scan your documents, or take a high quality digital camera picture, save the images as jpegs, then email
          us using our official email.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How do I know my documents are safe with you?</h2>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          The security of your documentation is of paramount importance. All files are protected with the highest level of
          encryption at every step of the review process. All documentation received is treated with the utmost respect
