      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-center mb-6">FAIRNESS & RNG TESTING METHODS</h1>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        At SHAKTIEX Gaming, we are committed to providing a fair and transparent gaming experience. This page explains how we ensure the fairness of our games through Random Number Generators (RNGs) and rigorous testing methods.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Random Number Generators (RNGs)</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        1.1. All games on our platform use certified Random Number Generators (RNGs) to determine game outcomes. RNGs are algorithms that generate sequences of numbers that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        1.2. Our RNGs ensure that:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Each game outcome is completely random and independent of previous outcomes</li>
        <li>No one, including SHAKTIEX Gaming staff, can predict or manipulate game results</li>
        <li>All players have the same chance of winning, based on the game's published odds</li>
        <li>Games operate according to their published rules and paytables</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. RNG Certification</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        2.1. Our RNGs are certified by independent testing laboratories that specialize in gaming technology, including:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>eCOGRA (eCommerce Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance)</li>
        <li>iTech Labs</li>
        <li>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI)</li>
        <li>BMM Testlabs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        2.2. These independent laboratories test our RNGs for:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Randomness: Ensuring that outcomes are truly random</li>
        <li>Unpredictability: Confirming that outcomes cannot be predicted</li>
        <li>Non-repeatability: Verifying that patterns do not emerge over time</li>
        <li>Fairness: Checking that the RNG produces results consistent with the game's theoretical return to player (RTP)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. Game Testing and Certification</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        3.1. In addition to RNG certification, all games on our platform undergo rigorous testing by independent laboratories before they are made available to players.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        3.2. Game testing includes:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Mathematical verification of game rules, paytables, and odds</li>
        <li>Verification that the game's actual return to player (RTP) matches its theoretical RTP</li>
        <li>Testing for game integrity and proper functioning under various conditions</li>
        <li>Verification that games comply with relevant regulatory requirements</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">4. Return to Player (RTP)</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        4.1. Return to Player (RTP) is a percentage that indicates the expected return to players over a large number of plays. For example, a game with an RTP of 96% will, on average, return $96 for every $100 wagered over the long term.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        4.2. The RTP for each game on our platform is:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Published in the game rules or information section</li>
        <li>Verified by independent testing laboratories</li>
        <li>Regularly audited to ensure compliance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        4.3. It's important to understand that RTP is a statistical average calculated over millions of game rounds. Individual playing sessions can deviate significantly from the theoretical RTP due to the random nature of game outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Ongoing Monitoring and Auditing</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        5.1. We conduct regular internal audits of our RNG systems and game performance to ensure continued fairness and compliance with regulatory standards.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        5.2. Our games are also subject to periodic re-testing and re-certification by independent laboratories.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        5.3. We maintain detailed logs of all game outcomes, which can be reviewed in case of disputes or regulatory inquiries.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">6. Provably Fair Technology</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        6.1. For certain games, we employ Provably Fair technology, which allows players to verify the fairness of game outcomes independently.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        6.2. Provably Fair technology works through a cryptographic system that:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Generates a random seed for each game</li>
        <li>Combines the server seed with a client seed provided by the player</li>
        <li>Uses this combination to determine game outcomes</li>
        <li>Allows players to verify that the outcome was not manipulated after the fact</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        6.3. Detailed instructions on how to verify game outcomes using our Provably Fair system are available in the help section of applicable games.
      </p>
