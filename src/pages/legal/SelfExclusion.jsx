      <p className="mb-4">
        At SHAKTIEX Gaming, we are committed to promoting responsible gambling. We recognize that gambling can become problematic for some individuals, and we provide tools and resources to help our players maintain control over their gambling activities.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What is Self-Exclusion?</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Self-exclusion is a formal process that allows you to voluntarily exclude yourself from accessing our gambling services for a specified period. During this time, you will not be able to access your account or place any bets, and we will take all reasonable steps to prevent marketing communications from reaching you.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Self-Exclusion Options</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-2">We offer the following self-exclusion periods:</p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">After Self-Exclusion</h2>
